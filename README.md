# **SEHURI**
*Cybersecurity as a Human Right*

## Philosophy

At **SEHURI**, we believe **cybersecurity is not a privilege, it’s a fundamental human right**. In a world where technology governs every aspect of our lives—from privacy to access to information—digital protection must be **universal, accessible, and empowering**.

The gap between those who can defend themselves online and those who cannot is a **systemic injustice**. Governments, corporations, and malicious actors exploit this inequality to **surveil, censor, and manipulate** the most vulnerable. At SEHURI, we fight for:
- **Democratizing knowledge**: Cybersecurity should not be an elite secret.
- **Tools for all**: Free, open-source, and user-friendly software and resources.
- **Tech activism**: Using technology to **defend rights**, not violate them.


> *"If privacy is a human right, cybersecurity is its shield."*
